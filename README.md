# CS_305_Software_Security
Final deliverable of coursework through CS 305 Software Security at SNHU. 

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

// Artemis Financial is a fianncial services company that requested assistance with enhancing the security of their software applicaiton. Their requested requirements were to imple ment a cryptographic hash algorithm and to ensure secure commincations in their applications along with make a recoomendation for an encryption algorithm. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

//I beleive I appropriately implemented the proper solutions to resolve any found vulnerabilities that could be addressed at the time. Secure coding is crucial because it protects sensitive data, maintains user trust and prevents unauthorized access to private/protected systems. Adding the appropriate software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by reducing the risk of breaches and data leaks, harbors a positive company reptuation and ensures regulatory compliance.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

//Learning how to perform the bulnerabilities assessment was extremely beneficial as it taught a valuable skill that can be utilized for numerous projects.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

// Layers of security were increased by implementing the crptographic SHA-256 hash algorithm, enabling secure communications using HTTPS and updating outdated and vulnerable dependencies. The OWASP Dependency-Check was a great tool to identify known vulnerabilities that manual reviewing code would not have captured, I beleive it is something that will be useful down the road. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

//To ensure the functionality and security of the code, I re-tested the apoplicaiton through the dependency check after refactoring the code and suppressing the error messages for known false-positive vulnerabilities. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

//Following industry standard best practices in general along with the OWASP guidelines/dependency check are valuable resources that will be useful for any project. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

//From this assignment I am able to demostrate my abilities to indentify and address security vulnerabilities to future employers through this final assignment.
